She's my sunshine in the rain
My Tylenol when I'm in pain yeah
Let me tell you what she means to me
Like a tall glass of lemonade
When it's burning hot on summer days
She's exactly what I need

She's soothing like the ocean rushing on the sand
She takes care of me baby
And she helps me be a better man
She's so beautiful sometimes I stop to close my eyes
She's exactly what I need

She's my smile when I'm feeling blue
She's my good night sleep when the day is through yeah
Let me tell you what she means to me

She's kinda like this
Kinda like the feeling after your first kiss
Except that everyday she makes me feel like this
She's exactly what I need
Oh yeah

She's soothing like the ocean rushing on the sand
She takes care of me baby
She helps me be a better man
She's so beautiful sometimes I stop to close my eyes
She's exactly what I need yeah

She's soothing like the ocean rushing on the sand
She takes care of me baby
She helps me be a better man
She's so beautiful sometimes I stop to close my eyes
She's exactly what I need

She's exactly what I need
